# News Search API

##### The purpose of this project is to practice React.js and API fetching.

##### This website uses the NewsAPI. The API has articles and breaking headlines from thousands of news sources and blogs, simply select a category or search a topic and it will show you headlines.

### Familiarized myself with:
> - Asychronous API (async.await)
> - React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
> - JSX, components, props, css modules, etc
